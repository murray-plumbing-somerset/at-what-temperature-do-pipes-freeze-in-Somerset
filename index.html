        <h2>Key Terminology</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Pipe Freezing</dt>
          <dd>The process in which water inside plumbing pipes freezes, potentially causing pipe rupture due to water expansion.</dd>
          <dt>Slab Leak</dt>
          <dd>A leak occurring under a concrete slab foundation, often requiring advanced diagnostic methods to detect.</dd>
          <dt>Hydro Jetting</dt>
          <dd>A method used to clear blockages in plumbing systems using high-pressure water jets to remove debris.</dd>
          <dt>Trenchless Technology</dt>
          <dd>A plumbing repair method that allows sewer lines to be replaced without digging, preserving landscaping.</dd>

        <h2>Process & Diagnostics</h2>
        <p>The detection and prevention of frozen pipes in Somerset requires thorough inspections and the use of modern technology. Techniques such as infrared cameras and electronic leak detection are employed to identify potential problem areas early. Preventative measures like insulation and hydro jetting can then be implemented to avoid pipe freezing and other plumbing issues.</p>
